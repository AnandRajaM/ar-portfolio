                                I love building complex projects and solving problems, a key strength of mine. Whether it's within my tech stack or from a different area of computer science, I never shy away from a challenge and always find a solution.

                                My love for technology and computer science began in junior high school when my friend and I ventured into freelance development for Discord and Telegram bots. These platforms had huge potential at the time and still do! We soon started receiving numerous orders and our efforts were recognized by Fiverr, where we were designated as rising talent. This boosted our sales by a huge margin and over several months we were able to sell over a hundred bots. Throughout this period, we developed numerous bots for various clients, including a chatbot for the notable RuneScape game. This era marked my "Golden period" in tech exploration, where I had the chance to study APIs, databases, Cloud, and more.

                            After graduating high school, I joined college as a freshman and developed a keen interest in AI and ML. Despite my busy schedule, I dedicated time to learning about these fields and participated in hackathons, winning several, including the prestigious IITR-Hackathon. Throughout my first year in college, I managed to juggle my studies, personal interests in AI, frontend/backend development, and hackathons, all of which kept me engaged and fulfilled.

                            Throughout my time as a freshman, I've learned numerous valuable lessons some of which are:
                                <br /> 
                                 - Teamwork is truly important and quite powerful.

                                - It's quite simple to learn new things if you love what you do.
                                <br />
                                - Competition is key for success allowing you to level up your own game.
                                <br />
                                - Persistence and a willingness to face challenges head-on are essential for growth and success.
